# Liham

Liham (formerly 4Uni) is a web-based platform designed to foster open, respectful, and meaningful discussions among university students, providing a safe, inclusive space for academic and social interaction outside the classroom through topic-based boards and threads. The forum encourages diverse perspectives, peer-driven content, and collaborative learning, promoting academic engagement in a virtual community.

> It aims to address the lack of safe, judgment-free spaces for college students outside school and on non-anonymous social media platforms.
